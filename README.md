# APM348_OR_Proj
This was my <a href="https://github.com/gabrielyiu1998/APM348_OR_Proj/blob/main/APM348Final%20report%20-%20(Jan%2013%2C%202021).pdf">final project</a>
for APM348 at University of Toronto. My team formulated an ice-cream production procedure
as a Markov Decision Process. We used reinforcement learning techniques (Q-Learning) to solve the model.

The uploaded report (APM348 Final Report) has been edited since the date of submission to fix typos and make writing clearer. The code has remained unchanged.

This project was done in collaboration with Zi Yang Chen and Guangzhi Sun.

### Project Highlights

#### Markov Decision Process
Found in page four of the report. The diagram describes the decision process and domain of choices.

#### Learned Schedule
Found in page nine of the report. This is the resulting production schedule with different probabilities of machine breakdown.
