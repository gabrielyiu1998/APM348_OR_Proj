# APM348_OR_Proj
APM348 operations research toy model. In this project, we construct a mathematical model for ice cream production and solve for an optimal decision policy.

The uploaded report (APM348 Final Report) has been edited since the date of submission to fix typos and make writing clearer. The code has remained unchanged.

This project was done in collaboration with Zi Yang Chen and Guangzhi Sun.
